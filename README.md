# SocioMark

SocioMark is an all-new social media platform that prioritizes image ownership and security using Machine Learning. By watermarking each image upon upload, the hash of the user is permanently encoded within the image. 

## How it Works
1. Users are first shown a landing page that requires the user to Login, Register with a new account, or learn more about the platform.
2. For the user to have access to all the functionality of the platform, they will need to Login or Register.
3. If a user already has an account, they can Login on the Landing Page. Otherwise, the user will be taken to a Register page, where they can set up an account.
4. The first page after logging in or registering is the feed page, which features a continuous feed of posts and image uploads. At the top of the feed page is a component that allows the user to upload a new image. There is also a suggested users component that lets the user navigate to the profiles of other users. 
5. Each post has the user name and profile of the user who uploaded the image, a comment section, a like feature, a flag button that lets users report image reuploads, and a Verify button on hover that checks if the image has the correct user hash.
6. If an image is reported 3 times, it is automatically removed, because the image was most likely stolen and reuploaded.
7. When uploading an image, the user can choose a file and include a description. The user's personalized hash is encoded as a watermark in the image when it is uploaded.
8. The user's profile page includes a bio, profile picture, and a feed of their posts. Clicking on Edit Profile navigates the user to a separate page that lets them change their profile picture, user name, and bio. 
9. There is a navbar that lets users switch between the feed page (home), profile page, and a search bar to search for users.
